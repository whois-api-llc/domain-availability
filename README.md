# Using the Domain Availability API web service

[Domain Availability API](https://domain-availability.whoisxmlapi.com/api)
checks whether the specified domain name is available for registration for
nearly all of the TLDs.

Here you'll find examples of querying the API implemented in multiple
languages.

You'll need a
[WhoisXmlApi account](https://domain-availability.whoisxmlapi.com/api/signup) to
authenticate.

This API also supports
[API key authentication](https://domain-availability.whoisxmlapi.com/api/documentation/making-requests).

Please, refer to the
[Domain availability API User Guide](https://domain-availability.whoisxmlapi.com/api/documentation/making-requests)
for info on input parameters, request/response formats, authentication
instructions and more.
