# Using the Domain Availability API web service

[Domain Availability API](https://www.whoisxmlapi.com/domain-availability-api.php)
checks whether a domain name is available for registration for nearly all of
the TLDs.

Here you'll find examples of using the API implemented in multiple languages.

You'll need a
[WhoisXmlApi account](https://www.whoisxmlapi.com/user/create.php) to
authenticate.

Please, refer to the
[Domain availability API User Guide](https://www.whoisxmlapi.com/domain-availability-api-guide.php)
for info on input parameters, request/response formats, authentication
instructions and more.
